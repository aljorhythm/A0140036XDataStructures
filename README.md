**Tutor:** Wang Xien Dong

## Instructions for Students

1. Clone this repository to begin working.
2. Do not modify the `AppDelegate.swift`, `LaunchScreen.xib`, `Main.storyboard`, `Images.xcassets` files (you do not have to).
3. Write your answers to non-coding questions in this file (`README.md`).

## Tips

1. CS3217's Gitbook is at https://www.gitbook.com/book/cs3217/problem-sets/details. Do visit the Gitbook often, as it contains all things relevant to CS3217. You can also ask questions related to CS3217 there.
2. Take a look at `.gitignore`. It contains rules that ignores the changes in certain files when committing an Xcode project to revision control. (This is taken from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignore).
3. A Swiftlint configuration file is provided for you. It is recommended for you to use Swiftlint and follow this configuration. Keep in mind that, ultimately, this tool is only a guideline; some exceptions may be made as long as code quality is not compromised.
4. Do not burn out. Have fun!

## Problem 1: Swift Collections

### Readings

- [Hashable - Swift Standard Library | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hashable)
- [Dictionary - Swift Standard Library _ Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary)

### Answers

If keys do not conform to Hashable protocol there is no standard to tell if two keys are equal. Keys can be of types that are not primitives like Integer or String, ie. they can be points on a plane, an object, etc. The implementation of Dictionary identifies keys by their .hashValue property.
